    This tool allows you to extract text from any PDF file by either providing its URL or uploading a file directly.
    The extracted text will be saved into a CSV file, which you can then use to calculate Term Frequency (TF), 
    Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), and TF-IDF. You can also check how many documents contain each term.
